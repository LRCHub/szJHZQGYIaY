I know I'm in the presence of my King
All my failures have been cast upon the wind
By a grace that never fails to draw me
Into Your love

Well, I'm seated at the table of the King
I am poor yet in Your mercy I am rich
In a way this world could never hope to give
Yes, I'm undone, yeah

O Jesus, You won't deny a broken melody
A humble sacrifice
O Jesus, we love Your name
We bless Your heart
And we give You praise

Tearing through the fences of my heart
Where pride had built the walls that kept me far
Sin did what it did, but grace did what it does
And makes a place for the placeless ones, oh

O Jesus, You won't deny a broken melody
A humble sacrifice
O Jesus, we love Your name
We bless Your heart
And we give You praise

O Jesus, You won't deny a broken melody
A humble sacrifice
O Jesus, we love Your name
We bless Your heart
And we give You praise

I'm not too proud to say I need You
I'm not too far to turn around (no)
'Cause it's the humble who receive You
Oh, God, I need You
Yes, I need You, oh

I'm not too strong to bow before You
(Oh, no, no)
You say Your grace comes for the weak (oh, Father)
So, if it's brokenness You're after
(I need You) I need You
(I need You) I need You

I'm not too proud to say I need You
I'm not too far to turn around
(I'm not too far to turn around)
'Cause it's the humble who receive You
I'm not afraid to say that
I need You, I need You

I'm not too strong to bow before You
You say Your grace comes for the weak
So, if it's brokenness You're after
I need You, I need You
I need You, I need You
I need You, I need You
I need You, I need You
I need You, I need You

I'm not too proud to say I need You
I'm not too far to turn around
I will be humble
I will be humble
'Cause it's the humble who receive You
Oh, God, I need You
I need You, I need You

I'm not too strong to bow before You
You say Your grace comes for the weak
So, if it's brokenness You're after
I need You, I need You
I need You, I need You

Oh, if it's brokenness You're after
If it's brokenness You want
I'm the perfect candidate
I'm the perfect candidate
I'm the perfect candidate

I'm broken
I'm broken
I'm broken
I'm broken

The highest place that I'll be is right at Your feet
The highest place that I'll be is right at Your feet
You're my focus
You're my prize
You're my goal, my one desire
I need You
(I need You)

Oh, I need You
I need You, Lord
I need You, Lord
I need You, Lord
I need You, Lord
I need You, Lord
I need You, Lord
I need You, Lord

I need You, Lord
I need You, Lord

I need You, Lord
Oh, I need You, oh, oh

Oh, Jesus, You won't deny
A broken melody
A humble sacrifice
O Jesus
We love Your name
We bless Your heart
And we give You praise
